	<h2>Which two websites are you inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://livwrk.com/">livwrk.com</a> and <a href="http://www.workstead.com/">workstead.com</a></p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
		<p><ul>
			<li>Workstead's pages are clean, simple, and well-balanced. Each page has a block that serves as a menu and provides textual information while the surrounding page provides a background that is illustrative of their work. The site is generally easy to navigate.</li>
			<li>Livwrk's homepage is straightforward and divided into 3 horizontal sections: the name, a mission statement, and a menu. Each page is well-balanced, with 2 or fewer columns, and with white space that accentuates the positive space.</li>
		</ul></p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>Workspace relies largely on the background to provide a relief for the text, while livwrk generally provides a more traditional 2-column layout for information. Neither website overwhelms with information; instead each provides easy access points for describing the company itself and leading to ways to utilize the company's resourses.</p>
